# Error Handling
Error handling is an essential part of writing robust and reliable smart contracts. It involves handling unexpected or invalid conditions that may occur during contract execution and ensuring that the contract behaves predictably even in the presence of errors.It allows developers to handle exceptional situations and prevent unexpected behavior in their code. The contract demonstrates the basic functionality of a smart contract and showcases the use of events, require statements, and the revert function.

# Description
The UpdatedContract is a simple Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the use of events, require statements, and the revert function. It allows users to set and retrieve a value, and includes a function that always reverts. This contract can serve as a starting point for more complex smart contracts that require similar functionality.
# Getting Started
Executing program To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/. Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol).

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UpdatedContract {
    uint256 public value;

    event ValueSet(uint256 newValue);

    function setValue(uint256 newValue) public {
        require(newValue != 0, "Value must not be zero");
        value = newValue;
        emit ValueSet(newValue);
    }

    function assertValue(uint256 expectedValue) public view returns (bool) {
        return value == expectedValue;
    }

    function revertFunction() public pure {
        revert("This function always reverts");
    }
}
```
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.0" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button. Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar.The setValue function allows users to set a new value. It checks if the new value is not zero using a require statement and updates the value variable. It also emits the ValueSet event.The assertValue function is a view function that checks if the current value is equal to the expected value. It returns a boolean indicating the result.The revertFunction is a pure function that always reverts.
